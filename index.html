                                        Generally no more than 5 different products. We suggest that it’s better to try different products to see which one is more comfortable as opposed to see what a complete setting might look like. For example, instead of trialing one table and four of the same chairs, it’s better to try one table and four different chairs to see which chairs best suit you. Wintons Teak reserves the right to limit the number of products that can be tried.

                                        The purpose for the product trial is to provide the same experience as you experience back in our showroom. This means you can interact with our products, for example, to take a look at the folding mechanism of a folding table or to sit on different dining chairs to find which is most comfortable for you. However, do not use the furniture, such as a dining table to dine or have a meal, just the same as if it’s in our showroom. This is because food stains such as those from red wine or butter need to be cleaned off professionally for the product to remain as a display product in our showrooms or trial products for the next customer.

                                        Wintons Teak outdoor furniture is designed for 100% outdoors and it’s not a problem to have some rain on or have it exposed to the full sun. However, please do not use it to dine or lay on after a swim. Stains from food scraps on table top or sunscreen/body fluids on cushion need to be cleaned off professionally for the product to remain as a display product in our showrooms or as trial products for the next customer. Simply interact with the product just as if you are in our showroom.
